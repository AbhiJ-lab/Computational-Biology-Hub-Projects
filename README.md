# Computational Biology Hub Modeling Projects

## 1. **Cardiovascular Risk Prediction using VLDL-P and hsCRP Rates**

In this project, I developed a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze the relationship between VLDL-P (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein Particle) and hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) ratesâ€”key cardiovascular biomarkers. The project involved building a local Dash app to visualize cardiovascular risk levels and creating a Random Forest Regressor model to predict hsCRP rates based on VLDL-P data. The analysis revealed a significant positive correlation, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Hybrid CNN for correlation analysis, Random Forest for hsCRP prediction.
- **Visualization**: Local Dash app for cardiovascular risk assessment.
- **Data Insights**: Significant positive relationship between VLDL-P and hsCRP.

## 2. **PARP-1 Enzyme Inhibition: A Computational Drug Discovery Approach**

This project focused on the inhibition of the PARP-1 enzyme using computational techniques, including QSAR analysis, chemical space exploration with PaDEL descriptors, Lipinski factors, and IC50 values. I performed a Mann-Whitney U test to assess the theoretical efficacy of chemical structures in inhibiting PARP-1. The project aimed to discover compounds that could mitigate adipose tissue expansion, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce chronic inflammation linked to obesity.

### Key Features:
- **QSAR and Chemical Space Analysis**: To identify potential inhibitors of PARP-1.
- **Mann-Whitney U Test**: To determine the efficacy of compounds.
- **Health Impact**: Targeting obesity-related inflammation and metabolic health.
